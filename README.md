# Runescape-Scripts
Old and new scripts that I wrote in my spare time to bot in the game Runescape


Runescape scripting was my introduction to coding.  I wrote dozens of scripts in my spare time when I was younger, and I'm attempting to compile them now as a resource. As I no longer have access to the files on a local computer, I've been spending time searching the internet to find old links to my code so that I may post them here and have them for looking back on in the future.

So far I have found a few old scripts of mine.  Two of the scripts actually have been viewed on pastebin over 1,500 times:

My plan is to hopefully find access to all of my old scripts (it seems they have mostly been archived and deleted on the sites they were originally posted on), and I'm hoping to start scripting again soon in my free time. 

If I start writing new scripts in my free time, it will be partly due to nostalgia of my original coding "adventures," but also because I am interested to apply my years of coding experience to this medium, and see what I can create.
