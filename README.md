# Runescape-Scripts
Old and new scripts that I wrote in my spare time to bot in the game Runescape


Runescape scripting was my introduction to coding.  I wrote dozens of scripts in my spare time when I was younger, and I'm attempting to compile them now to remember where I first started. As I no longer have access to the files on a local computer, I've been spending time searching the internet to find old links to my code so that I may post them here and have them for looking back on in the future.

So far I have found a few old scripts of mine.  Two of the scripts actually have been viewed on pastebin over 1,500 times:

My plan is to hopefully find access to all of my old scripts (it seems they have mostly been archived and deleted on the sites they were originally posted on).

If I start writing new scripts in my free time, it will be partly due to nostalgia of my original coding "adventures," but also because I am interested to apply my years of coding experience to this medium, and see what I can create.
